/**
 * What the device's chosen encoder will actually accept.
 *
 * Nothing used to check this: `hasEncoder()` confirmed only that *an encoder for the MIME exists*, and
 * the user's bit rate went straight into `KEY_BIT_RATE`. A `MediaCodec` handed an out-of-range value
 * does not reliably throw — it can clamp, or emit frames that decode to nothing, producing a
 * correctly-sized recording that plays silent. That is indistinguishable from the symptom in issue
 * #18, which closed without a cause.
 *
 * Encoders genuinely differ, measured on a OnePlus 12 (2026-07-31):
 *
 * | encoder | bit rate | sample rate | channels |
 * |---|---|---|---|
 * | `c2.android.aac.encoder` (software) | 8000-960000 | discrete list incl. 48000 | ≤ 6 |
 * | `c2.qti.aac.hw.encoder` (hardware)  | 4000-192000 | 8000-48000 | ≤ 2 |
 *
 * On that device the hardware one declares `special-codec required`, so `createEncoderByType` does not
 * pick it. A vendor that does not gate it that way hands us an encoder with different limits, and
 * before this we would never have known.
