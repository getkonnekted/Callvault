/**
 * Which app is on the VoIP call, taken from the audio system rather than from notifications.
 *
 * This is ground truth, not a guess: a VoIP app renders the remote voice as a playback track tagged
 * `USAGE_VOICE_COMMUNICATION`, that track is *the very stream this feature records*, and the audio
 * service knows which uid owns it. Asking anything else is asking a proxy.
 *
 * The previous approach — scanning notifications for one tagged `category=call` — was wrong on both
 * ends. Telegram's ongoing-call notification carries **no category at all**, so it never matched; and
 * an unrelated app's notification could match first, which is how a Telegram call was once filed under
 * WhatsApp and later under Google. Nothing here can misidentify the app, because there is exactly one
 * stream being captured and we read its owner.
 *
 * Only the daemon can do this. `getActivePlaybackConfigurations` is **anonymised** for callers without
 * `MODIFY_AUDIO_ROUTING` — the app would see the configurations with their usage and uid stripped, so
 * this same code in the app returns nothing on every device.
 *
 * Returns a uid, deliberately, and lets the app map it to a package: the daemon holds no `Context`, and
 * `PackageManager.getPackagesForUid` handles shared uids and work profiles properly where string
 * matching would not.
