 * Sends one recording to the system share-sheet.
 *
 * **The recording's own URI is shared directly, not a copy.** Recordings live in a folder the user
 * picked through the Storage Access Framework, so their URIs belong to a *documents provider* rather
 * than to us. That is shareable anyway: such providers declare `grantUriPermissions`, and a caller
 * holding a persisted read grant may extend a temporary one to whichever app the user picks. The
 * alternative — copying into our cache and re-exposing it through `FileProvider`, as
 * [shareLogFile] must do for a file we generate — would duplicate a recording that can run to tens of
 * megabytes and leave it in the cache afterwards.
 *
 * Both [Intent.EXTRA_STREAM] and [ClipData] carry the URI: some receivers read one and some the other,
 * and the grant travels with the clip data on every Android version we support.
 *
 * @param uri         The copy to share. A recording present both on the device and in Drive has one
 *                    URI per copy; the caller decides which, and the audio is identical either way.
 * @param displayName Shown as the subject where a receiver uses one (mail, mostly).
