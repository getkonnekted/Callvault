/**
 * Collects the daemon's and the system's log lines for a bug report, over the privileged shell.
 *
 * **Why any of this is needed.** The recorder daemon is a separate shell-uid process; it cannot write
 * the app's log file, and its stdout is deliberately discarded (keeping that stream open let `adbd`
 * kill the child before it finished starting). Everything it says goes to logcat and nowhere else, so
 * a debug report built only from `app_debug.log` shows one side of the conversation. Issue #18 spent a
 * week there: the exported log was clean end to end because the failure lived in the half nobody
 * could see.
 *
 * The system's own lines are the larger half of the value. Our daemon could at best have said "I
 * captured N bytes"; `AudioFlinger` is where "your capture was silenced" is actually recorded.
 *
 * Everything here is best-effort. No shell, no permission, or an unreadable response means the report
 * is built without this half rather than not built at all.
