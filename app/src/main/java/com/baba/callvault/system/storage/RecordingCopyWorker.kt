/**
 * Copies a finished recording from the local SAF folder to the Drive SAF folder and, when the storage
 * target is cloud-only, deletes the local source afterwards.
 *
 * The copy is idempotent and atomic (see [SafHelper.copyFileToFolder]), which matters because this
 * worker is retried: before that was true, every retry uploaded the recording *again*, so Google Drive
 * announced "saved a call" long after the call ended and the folder collected truncated twins.
 *
 * Retries are bounded by [CloudCopyPolicy.MAX_ATTEMPTS]. Giving up is reported to the user and leaves
 * the local file untouched — a recording that is only on the device is recoverable; one that is silently
 * absent from both places is not.
