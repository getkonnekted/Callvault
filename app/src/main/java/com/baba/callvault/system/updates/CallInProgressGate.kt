/**
 * Whether it is safe to install an update right now.
 *
 * Installing an APK over the running app kills the app process, and any recording in flight dies with
 * it. Seen on a device on 2026-07-30: one call became two files, and the second was mislabelled `out_`
 * with no contact name, because on restart the app read the still-running call as a fresh outgoing
 * one. Nothing was lost — the first file closed cleanly — but the call was split, and the seam was
 * silent for as long as the app took to come back.
 *
 * The updater is tap-to-install, so a user initiates it; nothing stops them tapping Install while
 * talking, and an update notification is exactly the kind of thing people poke at idly.
 *
 * **Known limit, stated rather than papered over:** a call that *starts* during an install is a few
 * seconds this cannot close. Closing it would mean aborting the installer mid-stream, and a
 * half-written APK is a broken app — worse than the problem.
