/**
 * Whether Wireless debugging can be switched off once the daemon is running.
 *
 * CallVault's principle is "Wireless debugging only while it is needed" — but switching it off is not
 * always free. **`adbd` shuts down when its last transport is removed**, and the daemon is a child of an
 * `adbd` shell session, so turning off the *only* transport kills the daemon we just launched. Measured
 * on a Galaxy S24 FE: the daemon died 50-90 ms after each disable, the keep-alive relaunched it, the
 * relaunch re-enabled Wireless debugging, and the cycle repeated six times over two minutes with the app
 * never reaching "ready to record". The same code looked fine on a OnePlus only because USB debugging
 * was enabled there — a second transport that kept `adbd` alive and masked the bug entirely.
 *
 * So the rule is: **never remove `adbd`'s last transport while the daemon has to stay alive.** This
 * decision is kept free of `Context` so it can be tested exhaustively, which matters because every
 * branch here was a real device behaviour rather than a guess.

     * **An armed loopback listener does NOT count.** That was assumed once and it was wrong: measured on
     * a Galaxy S24 FE running 1.4.8, with the loopback armed and USB debugging off, disabling Wireless
     * debugging still killed the daemon 57 ms later and the loop returned. `service.adb.tcp.port` is a
     * persisted *setting*, not a live transport — turning Wireless debugging off restarts `adbd` anyway,
     * the daemon dies with it, and the loopback only comes back ~12 s later, by which point the launcher
     * has given up and re-enabled Wireless debugging.
     *
     * Only USB debugging was ever actually proven to hold `adbd` up (toggling Wireless debugging on and
     * off left `adbd`'s pid unchanged and the daemon alive). The earlier belief that loopback did the
     * same came from a test run while USB debugging happened to be on — USB was doing the work.
     *
     * Restoring "Wireless debugging off" for loopback users needs a different shape: switch it off
     * BEFORE launching the daemon, wait for the loopback to return, and launch over that. See
     * `docs/dev-notes/backlog.md`.
