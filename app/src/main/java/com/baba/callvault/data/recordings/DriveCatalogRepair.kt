/**
 * Re-points catalog rows whose Drive URI was issued under a folder grant we no longer hold.
 *
 * **Why a stored Drive URI stops working.** Google Drive's SAF document URIs carry the account slot they
 * were issued for — `…/tree/acc=1;doc=encoded=…`. That slot is an index, not an identity, and Drive
 * renumbers it when accounts are added, removed or re-ordered. Measured on 2026-08-04: every stored URI
 * pointed at `acc=1`, the live grant was `acc=4`, and every Drive call threw
 * `SecurityException: Permission Denial` — uploads, deletes and folder listings alike. Re-picking the
 * folder in Settings restores the grant, but does nothing for the URIs already written into the catalog.
 *
 * **Why that would otherwise be permanent.** A row holding a dead Drive URI is stuck between the two
 * halves of the retention sweep: the catalog pass tries the dead URI and fails for ever, while the
 * untracked pass skips the file because the row claims a Drive copy already exists. The recording becomes
 * undeletable — the same shape of trap that stranded 124 files, arrived at from the other direction.
 *
 * So each sweep re-points what it can and forgets only what is genuinely absent, and the file is then
 * governed normally again.
