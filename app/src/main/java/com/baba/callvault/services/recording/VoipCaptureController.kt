/**
 * Keeps the daemon's VoIP capture policy armed whenever the feature is on.
 *
 * The policy has to be registered BEFORE a VoIP call's audio track is created — Android fixes a
 * track's routing at creation, so arming once a call is under way leaves it permanently unattached and
 * the recording comes out silent rather than merely clipped. There is therefore no "arm on call start"
 * option: it is armed when the user enables the feature, re-armed whenever the daemon is (re)launched,
 * and left armed. That costs nothing while idle — measured on-device, an armed policy holds no wakelock
 * and no active record track, so the phone still sleeps normally.
