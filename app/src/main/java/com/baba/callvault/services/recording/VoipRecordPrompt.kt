/**
 * The "an app call is happening — record it?" prompt, shown while **Ask me** is selected for app
 * calls and a call is under way that CallVault has deliberately not started recording.
 *
 * **Why this is a separate notification from the keep-alive one.** The keep-alive notification would
 * be the obvious place — it already reports VoIP recording, and reusing it costs nothing. But its
 * channel is `IMPORTANCE_MIN`, chosen precisely so a permanent status note stays out of the way: no
 * heads-up, no lock screen, collapsed to the bottom of the shade. A prompt nobody sees is not a
 * prompt. This one goes on the same high-importance channel as the carrier standby prompt, which
 * exists for exactly the same purpose and has to be equally visible.
 *
 * It is transient by construction: shown when the call starts, cancelled the moment recording begins
 * or the call ends. [RecordingNotificationHelper.createNotificationChannels] owns the channel.
