/**
 * Answers the one question Track A turns on: **can the app start a capture track it was handed, itself?**
 *
 * Capture permission is checked when a track is CREATED, not when it is started, and a track created
 * before a call and started at call-connect has been measured delivering real audio (−6.7 dBFS against
 * a −5.6 dBFS control). So if AudioFlinger accepts a `start` from the app's uid on a track the daemon
 * created, the daemon becomes a once-per-boot track factory and leaves the call path entirely — no ADB,
 * no debugging switch, and no 18-second cold start when a call arrives.
 *
 * If it refuses, Track A cannot remove the daemon from the call path and we stop there. Either answer
 * is worth having; neither is worth guessing at.
 *
 * Deliberately a probe rather than a feature: it runs only when invoked explicitly through the
 * provider, does no recording, and holds nothing afterwards.
