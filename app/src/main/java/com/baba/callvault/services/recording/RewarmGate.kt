/**
 * Decides whether a daemon relaunch may start now. Two rules, and one hard-won third.
 *
 *  - **One at a time.** Two concurrent launches disconnect and reconnect on each other mid-connect and
 *    thrash the embedded ADB connection into a "Stream closed" state.
 *  - **Throttled.** An un-forced (watchdog) attempt waits [throttleMs] after the last one, so a launch
 *    that keeps failing is not hammered. A confirmed binder death passes `force = true` and skips this
 *    — a genuine recovery must not sit out the throttle. Force does *not* skip the one-at-a-time rule.
 *  - **In-flight state expires.** This is the fix for the 2026-07-30 field wedge, and the reason this
 *    logic is a separate testable class rather than two fields on the service.
 *
 * The wedge: the in-flight flag used to be cleared *only* by the worker thread finishing. That worker
 * calls `ensureServerRunning`, which could block indefinitely on a half-dead ADB connection — so a
 * single hung attempt latched the flag true for the life of the process, the 60 s watchdog returned at
 * its first line forever, and recording stopped silently. Found after ~21 hours down on a device that
 * otherwise looked perfectly healthy. Treating an attempt older than [stuckAfterMs] as abandoned means
 * the worst case is one lost window, not a permanent outage.
 *
 * Thread-safe: [tryEnter] is called from the watchdog's handler thread while [leave] is called from the
 * relaunch worker it spawned, so the state genuinely crosses threads and both methods are synchronized.
 * Without that, the handler thread could keep observing a stale `inFlight = true` and wait out
 * [stuckAfterMs] before retrying a relaunch that had in fact already finished.
 *
 * @param stuckAfterMs age past which an in-flight attempt is presumed abandoned and may be superseded.
 *   Must comfortably exceed a healthy `ensureServerRunning`, or a slow-but-working launch gets a
 *   competitor.
 * @param throttleMs minimum gap between un-forced attempts.
