/**
 * Icons for the app a VoIP recording came from, loaded from the **installed app itself**.
 *
 * Deliberately not bundled artwork: WhatsApp, Signal and Telegram logos are trademarks, and shipping
 * them in a FOSS app is a licensing problem we do not need. Reading the icon the user already has
 * installed avoids that entirely, and stays correct when an app rebrands.
 *
 * VoIP recordings carry the app's *label* in their filename rather than its package (the daemon cannot
 * resolve a label — that needs a Context it must not obtain), so the label is matched back to an
 * installed package once and cached. Both the label→package map and the decoded icons are cached
 * because this is consulted while scrolling a list.
